Pixi.js based slots game

You can try it on http://game2.cyberdex.info

First of all, this project needs Webpack:

npm install webpack

Once we have installed webpack just clone this repository, and install it:

npm install

Now you can use npm start or npm run dev to start watching and compiling files, or npm run build to create a minified, ready to production file.
